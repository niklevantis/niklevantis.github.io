>**DIN Is Noise is a computer program, You can use your mouse and keyboard to make sounds Inspired by central-asian bowed string instruments, The Morin Khuur, the Kobyz, the Erhu, the Kamancheh, the Sarangi, and Cello.**
 An excellent Theremin when you arent playing right ;)  Or play a raga of Indian classical music, OK, it is a sound synthesizer. Yes, it can accept input from your MIDI keyboard: Notes, control change, pitch bend and clock sync and5 oscillators.

1 for lead voice on the Microtonal Keyboard.
1 for plucked notes on the Keyboard-Keyboard.
1 for the balls of Mondrian.

And 2 for drones. Goodbye again, Sine, Triangle, Pulse and Saw,
While we install Bezier curves on Carriers and Modulators,
Chowning's Yamaha pipe still pours $$$
