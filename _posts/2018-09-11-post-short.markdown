> I've noticed that some bloggers are putting agonising efforts to show off Thousands of meaningless words  and  these kind of articles could be written with 10 words but  they have to show that they are something special in this world .... 

##By finishing this post, SVBTLE warns me that it's too short ...  
In a world that observes the following is reasonable that everything around us is programmed according to  ..

* Passive acceptance and coexistence
* Poor aesthetics and life goals
* Opinions built on common and safe recruits
* Consumerism and Discrimination
* Success without a strong philosophy of life
* Understanding only that we perceive it as safe for us
* Lack of judgment and perception of diversity
* Lifestyle  that fits only the views we have learn & adopted
* Compromise ...
* Vanity..
