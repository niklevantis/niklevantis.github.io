>I am particularly pleased about the inclusion of my musical ideas as demo songs for [Radium Music Editor](http://users.notam02.no/%7Ekjetism/radium/) . Radium evolves from the developer of the legendary Octamed (Amiga) Kjetil Matheussen.

Radium is a music editor with a revolutionary interface. Compared to the normal sequencers (or DAW if you prefer) interface editing is quicker and more musical data fits on the screen.

Compared to  [trackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_tracker), note positions and effects are edited graphically, which should be quicker, provide more vertical space and give a better musically overview. (Everything can also be edited by text, like in a normal tracker)

However, despite its unusual appearance, it's a design goal for Radium to be straightforward to use, and easy to learn. It should not be harder to learn Radium than any tracker or most MIDI sequencers. Users who are accustomed to more traditional trackers might use a little bit time in the beginning getting used to the interface. 

The development of Radium started in 1999 based on ideas developed 1997-1999 while extending the Octamed tracker on the Amiga. The first public version of Radium was released in 2000. Since then Radium has been ported to Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. Radium is one of the oldest and most advanced tracker-like music editors of today.
