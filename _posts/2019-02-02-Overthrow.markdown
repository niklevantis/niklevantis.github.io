>***We do what we learn with mapped consciousness and mode of operation. Always with fixed obligations that determine our existence on this planet.***

Undoubtedly we stand and act hypocritically against our nature and towards our creator who "inadvertently" placed us somewhere in this universe. Being destructive, greedy and rude, with an overly selfish disrespecting to our surrounding area, we want to save and exalt our souls. Religions, philosophies good and evil be born from us to us  in order to soften the uncertainty of our problematic nature. The "must" on our everyday life eventually awakens "anarchist instincts" into our subconscious. And that's where everything starts. The notions of good and evil no longer have any distinct boundaries ... And our brain can not be persuaded of everything that has implanted us, Destabilizing so overthrow and zeroing ...
