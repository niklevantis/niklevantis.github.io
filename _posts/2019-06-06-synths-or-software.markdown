Some musicians believe that computers are not capable for creating nice electronic music like synths. They forget that synthesizers are basically computers and their circuits create waveforms and filters to synthesize sounds. They forget that the medium is not what makes the music but only the musician, his imagination, his experimentation are the things that give life and diversity to the sounds and notes.
