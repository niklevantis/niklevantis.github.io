Born on March 26, 1965, in Athens, Greece, Nick Levantis grew up in a fertile cultural and musical period at the early eighties .</p>

<p>He started his first post punk band called “Prisoners” at the age of fifteen together with his best friend Leo doing their first rehearsals and concerts in the grey industrial zone of Piraeus port .</p>

<p>Their second band “Tarot” was more experimental with influences from different genres : punk, new wave and electronic music.</p>

<p>They played many times live, got good reviews from music critics but their aim was purely to express their inner world presenting unique music ideas without being particularly concerned about some “serious” things in our societies (fame, money?) .</p>

<p>At mid eighties Nick’s computer programming studies helped him to step deeper into the world of electronic music, and he started composing &amp; experimenting with his trusty Atari and a bunch of synths.</p>

<p>At late eighties was the singer and guitar player , in a fairly successful alternative underground band at that time in Greece, Sonar Blips (Wipe Out Records).</p>

<p>Today Nick is taking elements from the last three decades and combining them with new interesting electronic music genres . He creates music with no limits and borders with the believing that “there is no music evolution in art without the presence of internal or social revolution . Εven fake revolutions are better than zero”</p>

<p>The last two years has created a total of thirty nine songs that are meant to travel the listener to the magical world of electronic music. You can find full list of Nick songs on Soundcloud</p>
