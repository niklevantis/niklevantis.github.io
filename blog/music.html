<h1>Music.. ??</h1>
<small>[<a href='../2020.html#music'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='music.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<h2>Who thinks it’s easy to create nice and unique music? Obviously not .. In addition to music studies, we need images and feelings and, moreover, a daily life full of questions about what exactly surrounds us.</h2>

<p>
Unfortunately, we live in the age of social networking and our precious time is spent in front of screens .. I know musicians who spend more than half a day in front of the computer .. not to write music but to communicate in the facebook with the hope that they will become known and successful …..

Ιt is at least ridiculous and vain to hunt for success without having any serious esoteric reason to do so. Without dreams, fantasy and creative life, there is no real art other than repetition and recycling.</p>
