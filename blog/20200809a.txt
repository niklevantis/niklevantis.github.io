Several months passed without any presence on the internet. Sometimes isolation
is necessary to fight and find your self through time,thoughts and emotions.
And some words of Platonas (Plato) philosopher:
"The first and greatest victory is to conquer yourself; to be conquered by
yourself is of all things most shameful and vile."
