After many years of using OSX and macs and spending thousands of euros to buy them ..I came up with the operating system that I happened to put experimentally on my computer 25 years ago (ret hat linux at that time). So Linux again in combination with a custom environment created with the dwm window manager .. everything is now easily controlled via keyboard shortcuts, my computer is 2 times faster than with OSX. I use many open source applications which of course I try to learn with the sole exception of my favorite music tracker renoise ..
