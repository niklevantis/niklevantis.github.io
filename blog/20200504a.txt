title: "Kiss Linux"

---

It's basically the first time I've simplified my computer
needs. And Kiss Linux offers just that. Simplicity and
functionality directly at the point of things. No 
unnecessary windows and overloaded applications and all
you need is a good terminal (f) and enough mood to change
the time-consuming way you have learned to handle computers
for so many years ... It is the way of the unsurpassed 
philosophy of Unix operating system that operating systems
like OSX and WIndows are far from it. Booting in 8 seconds
to WM in the old 10 year old imac with initial memory usage
of 89Mb is far from the 3GB used by OSX .. They will follow 
in another post screenshots because apart from being 
functional it is also beautiful.
