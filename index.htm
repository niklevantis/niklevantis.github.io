<h2>ABOUT</h2>
<p>Born  in Athens, Greece, Nick grew up in a fertile cultural and musical period at the early eighties. He started his first post punk band called Prisoners at the age of fifteen together with his friends doing their first rehearsals and concerts in the grey industrial zone of Piraeus port.</p>
<p>At mid eighties Nick computer programming studies and synths knowledge helped him to step deeper into the world of electronic music and digital art. Alongside the same time tried to express images and feelings through digital art creations combining with his musical ideas and experimented so to create interactivity between them.  </p>
										
			
 <p>At early nineties was the singer and guitar player in a fairly successful alternative underground band at that time in Greece, Sonar Blips (Wipe Out Records). Over the years he has played and collaborated with many other musicians experimenting through different musical genres.</p>
 <p>Today Nick is creating pieces of music trying to differentiate and surpass the limits of specific genres with the believing that there is no evolution in art without the presence of internal or social revolution.</p>
<p>The last two years has created a total of forty four genre agnostic songs which contain many avant-garde and minimalist elements that are meant to travel the listener to the magical world of electronic music.
