    bio: Nick grew up in a fertile cultural and musical period in the early eighties. Programming and synths helped him to step deeper into the world of electronic music and computer art. Over three decades he has played and collaborated with many other musicians experimenting through different styles. Today is creating pieces of music and is trying to differentiate and surpass the limits of specific genres. The last three years has created many genre agnostic songs that are meant to travel the listener to the magical world of electronic music.
