Eugene Broumidis and Nick Levantis began playing and writing music in the early eighties influenced initially by the punk and new wave bands of that era. Through three decades of common and uncommon musical exploration and societal experiences they've made personal projects and also formed and played in Greek Bands TNT, Prisoners, Joint, Tarot, Sonar Blips , Ethereal Movement. 

Today with Paralogik which is a paraphrase of the Greek word "παράλογο", they're trying to present through music something quite different by combining elements of electronic music with atmospheric guitars and dark vocals. Their industrial and dark electronic sound travels through ethereal and nostalgic melodies with lyrics that touch many unresolved social concerns ..
