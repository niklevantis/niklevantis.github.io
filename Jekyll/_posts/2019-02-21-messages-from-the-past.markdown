Messages from the past have left deep marks on you .. You look at me like Iâ€™m someone else. I understand .. Your memories are powerful and they encapsulate your present. The way you react its only your past that crushes the present. You wake up through your oblivion and release your captured thoughts and feelings that have never been answered. Rage in your thoughts and your mind play dirty games .. Blind feelings are driving  your soul today. And we are lost forever .. In your past..
