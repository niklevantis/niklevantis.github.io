>Sonar Blips was a short lived band from Athens that was formed in the late 80’s.

Most of the members of the band, like the guitar player Nikos Levantis and the bass player George “Rakos” Kagialedakis were former members of several Greek punk rock and new wave bands during the 80’s that had no releases.

Sonar Blips’s sound was refreshing for the Greek underground scene and that is the main reason why they pretty soon were on heavy radio rotation.

Their music could be categorised as pop/new wave in the spirit of the English bands of the late 80’s/early 90’s, like the Happy Mondays, Soup Dragons, Inspiral Carpets, Stone Roses and others.

Fronted by a male and a female singer, Michalis Naoum and greek-american Angeliki, they managed to release a same titled album in 1991 and soon their track “Coincidence” became a radio hit.
